# ProgrammingElixir
Update: I love elixir but have decided to get into cloud solutions recently (2017) and have put this book down for the time being.
This is a repository for all of the exercises in Programming Elixir 1.3 by Dave Thomas. At the time of creating this repository I have read through chapter 8 and may skip over the first few chapters.
